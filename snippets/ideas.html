<h3>Prime Numbers as base for a vector space</h3>
	While learning about Fourier I had the idea that Prime numbers might be considered a vector space, with the base vectors being the prime numbers, and the action you perform between them is multiplication instead of addition. In this case the vector multiplier will actually be the power of the prime number. <br>
	For example:<br>
		<math>60=2^2*3*5=2*e_2+e_3+e_5</math>
	Or something similar.
	<br>
	Obviously such a vector space would be of infinite dimention. I am currently waiting to learn about Hilbert spaces in order to develop this ides further.

<h3>An Apriori Basis for Ethics</h3>
	Well, as a first disclamer, I don't think such a thing is possible. When thought of through Witgenstein's (Or Kant's) notions of shape and content (those are direct translations from hebrew. I am not sure those are the correct terms in english) I think you can see that ethical questions are usually questions of content, as the classical train problem shows. As such I think that knowledge of shape (Mathematics) is inapplicable in those cases. This can negate the idea of Utilitarianism, as you can no longer perform the calculations required for it.

	Martin Buber provides us with an Apriori basis of ethics, but as existantialism goes, that provides us with no clear rules of conduct in ethical manners 
	<br>
	Perhaps a distiction is needed between "indirect" ethical situations and "direct" ethical situations. "Indirect" situations would be those that leaders often find themselves in. In those situations it seems that Utilitarianism actually works very well. These are also devoid of direct contact with the humans that the descision will affect.

	I will add more about the direct cases at a later date.
