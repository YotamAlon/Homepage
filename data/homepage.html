	<h1>Hey Everyone!</h1>
	Welcome to my website. This was built by me from scratch. I used bootstrap for some default designing, but removed it later on.
	<br><br>
	So what can you find here?
	<br>
	This is where I keep most of my project notes, ideas and opinions. If you are here because you got my resume, feel free to look around. My "Resume" page will contain my resume, and some extra stuff I didn't want to put in it.
	<br><br>
	If you are interested in one of my programming projects, you can find some background information under the "Projects" page (obviously).
	<br>
	Have a handsome rest of your day!
