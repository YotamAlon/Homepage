	<h2>Netget</h2><br>
	When I started working with VMware I had Ubunte installed on my computer. As it turns out, when bridging my network interface to the VM, it is unable to contact the DHCP service. That forced me to extract the netmask and default gateway and ask for a static IP everytime I wanted to use the brifge.
	<br>
	Netget is a small python tool, used to quickly display that information on a linux system.
	<br>
	It can be compiled using PyInstaller.

	<h2>AirGui</h2><br>
	After completing the Kali Linux course I had the idea to make a GUI for the AirCrack suite of tools. I tried to use the Kivy framework (GUI framework for Python), but was too unfamiliar with it to use it effectively.
	<br>
	With time I lost interest, but the idea itself might serve as the jumping board for other, related ideas.
	<br><br>

	<h2>Automation Master</h2><br>
	I wrote around 4-5 different scripts during my work at DigiTrust. After a while I thought it might be a good idea to create a tool to help me in production.
	<br>
	Automation Master is written in Python using the Kivy framework. Unlike AirGui, by the time I went to write this project I was much more familiar with Kivy. 
	<br>
	The idea was to create a window that allows me to input any text, or files needed as input for the scripts, and see the output, and logging information is a single screen.
	<br>
	I wanted to create a different tab for each script, but that feature proved to be very difficult to use with Kivy. I stoped working on it mainly because I got into the exam period and by the time I was done, the Security Analyst position at DigiTrust was significantly expanded, and the work load did not offer me the time to continue scripting.
	<br>
	I will definitely go back and try to finish it. I might change it a bit, perhaps writing it in C# which is more consistent for writing GUI application. My only concern with that is the python integration, but I might use that chance to allow it to work with several languages. That sounds like a useful tool.
